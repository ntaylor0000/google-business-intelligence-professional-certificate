**File Summary:**
- Test your knowledge: Database performance (Practice Quiz: 100%)
- Module 2 challenge (Graded Quiz: 100%)

## Module 2
**Dynamic database design**

You’ll learn more about database systems, including data marts, data lakes, data warehouses, and ETL processes. You’ll also investigate the five factors of database performance: workload, throughput, resources, optimization, and contention. Finally, you’ll consider how to design efficient queries that get the most from a system.
**Learning Objectives**
- Discover strategies to create an ETL process that works to meet organizational and stakeholder needs and maintain an ETL process efficiently.
- Understand what the different data storage and extraction processes and tools may include (Extract/L: Stitch/Segment/Fivetran, Transform: DBT/Airflow/Looker).
- Explain how to optimize when building new tables.
- Identify and describe where new tables can fit in the pipeline.
- Recognize the different aspects of databases, including OLAP and OLTP, columnar and relational, distributed and single-homed databases.
- Understand the importance of database performance and optimization.
- Describe the different five factors of database performance: workload, throughput, resources, optimization, and contention.
- Perform pipeline debugging using queries.
